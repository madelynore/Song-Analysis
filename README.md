# Geographic variation of song in Townsend's Warblers across their breeding range

##About this project

In New World Warblers, song is learned and gives a record of cultural evolution within a species. Townsend's Warbler( _Setophaga townsendii_) hybridizes with Hermit Warblers ( _Setophaga occidentalis_) in the Southern end of their range. A past hybridization event as left the trace of Hermit mtDNA in the coastal range of Townsend's Warbler, but not in the interior range of Townsend's Warblers. 

By looking at areas of noted genetic differentiation, I hope to illucidate understanding about the link between genetics and culture. I will track Townsend's Warbler song across their breeding range, to see if there are geographic differences in song that correspond to the documented genetic differences.

## Data

Utilizing citizen science projects, Xeno Canto and Macauley Library, I have __129 recordings__ from across the Townsend's Warbler breeding range. 

These recordings will be analyzed to extract quantitative and qualitative measurements, such as:
* Number of unique syllables in a song
* Number of notes per syllable
* Minimum frequency
* Maximum frequency
* Average frequency
* Song duration
